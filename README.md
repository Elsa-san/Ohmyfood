Openclassrooms project 4

Improve the interface of a mobile site with CSS animations

**Goal**

To develop a website proposing the menu of 4 great Parisian restaurants, with animations.

**Deliverables**

Homepage
Menu pages (4 in total)

**Animations**

The effects accessible by clicking or hovering are visible on the model. They must use
CSS animations or transitions, no JavaScript or libraries. 
When hovering or clicking, we must have the opposite effect when we leave the hover.

● Buttons
 On hover, the background color of the main buttons will need to lighten slightly.
The drop shadow will also need to be more visible.
Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For this, a
heart-shaped "Like" button is present on the layout. When clicked, it should
gradually fill up. For this first version, the effect can appear on
on desktop instead of the click.

● Homepage
When the application will have more menus, a "loader" will be necessary. On this
mockup, we want to have a preview of it. It should appear for 1 to 3
seconds when we arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and
use CSS animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined,
so any proposal is welcome as long as it is consistent with the
graphic charter of the site.

● Menu pages

Upon arrival on the page, the dishes should appear progressively with a slight
staggered in time. They can appear either one by one or in groups
"Starter", "Main course" and "Dessert".
The visitor can add the dishes he wants to his order by clicking on them.
This will make a small check mark appear to the right of the dish. This tick will have to slide from
from the right to the left. For this first version, the effect can appear on mouseover
on desktop instead of clicking. If the title of the dish is too long, it should be trimmed with
suspension points.

**Technologie**

Allowed : HTML, CSS, CSS preprocessor (Sass)
Prohibited : JavaScript, inline CSS

**Compatibility**

This website is mobile first and must be responsive. On tablet and desktop, the site will have to adapt, but these supports are not the priority.
The pages must pass the W3C validation in HTML and CSS without errors.

The site must be compatible with Chrome and Firefox.
